this week:
nice clothes
businesscards  https://www.tanabutr.co.th/en/print-on-demand-bangkok/business-card/premium-paper
website + first projects processed and uploaded
get a fucking job and apartment back in europm choose a place and try
---------



when the website isfinished, 
wednseday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday

apply to iaac, madrid, rmit, mit everywhere 


--------

adjustable spritesheet maps
post processing files for every folder. this means dot files for some stuff for custom processing
annotations on lowest level.
gif animation needs to be custom, not all same speed




urgency  🔥
ease of implementation ⭐

ui
zoom, tooslow
fix scrollbars
slidable divs
not 50% text width? too much?

navigation
add my comment back in global vars


in loading screen, add performnt images load and spritesheets and stacks
no pan in 3d vieport, is not nice navigation. we should make this a constraint or somethingu

show in the treeview where the .stop_accum files ar red dot?

zoom levels adjust , + also i dont think they are influenced by boundingbox
need to optimize again, i think i have too many listeners overloading memory
fix the scrollbars, looks stupid


bugs:
 tags at bottom of texts moves when i scroll.......
the bottons < and > bottom right does not work anymore

foldable tree view with correct loading on click, no double loeading when expanding or collapsing the tree. 🔥 ⭐⭐ text underneath tree?, tree in the middle of screen?  🔥 ⭐ floating and collapsible tree view. ⭐⭐⭐

bigger font for important stuff
seperate styling in index 🔥  
reconsider different packing alforithm for 2d packing
make it browser comaptible. chromium works ok, firefor and safari needs testin
	scroll buttons

make a mobile version
a lot of work, ventralize the the treeview






in progress-------------------------
when going to custom url, i need to go back and forth. not supported now
make 3d auto gif maker houdini setup
add support for multi stack ganimated grifs
little loading screen on startup loading in textures
when i have .accum file containing a number, this is the number i would like the text to be visible in the parent  reversed. 
open website on random folder
have custom url links so i can send people the exact scene i want 🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥⭐⭐⭐
startup screen
loading screen
coment out helpers

text no accum in mid folder, if found, no div
switch orientation of the text/3d layer. left-right, now always the same
stop __STOPACCUM__in filename , is stupid
fix the damn text. .accum
made orderd_grid_layout an global var 

1.5 x 1.5  has 0.1 height  ==> 10 iterations / unit
1 x 1 also, this is incorect. should be   more like 0.667 is moe like 14 iterations/unit



delete spritesheet folder before starting. fresh start

async loading for small stacks, instant loading for big stacks
make a website duplicate for git. now 

data,json is waay too big + spritesheets are too big. compress these

filesize long json names: 14mb
filesize short json names:

add effects to image spritesheet creation e.g. remove black bg to alpha
make adjustable variables for image compression, resolution, spriteresolution etc
bin stacking 3d models

spritesheet, what kind of scaling algo do you use. nearest neighbour?
can this be am option 


make sure the annotations dont come to other div, hidden.
** houdini sim needs a way to check the height of the clip. now its always the same, no way for higher builds

 issue i notice. it seems that (even though i did not write, a proper grid layout is found in the correct files) , the second parent to the image folder is not dipalying the grid proper. └──

make small text
annotations go over div
1) determine the bounding box of the total stack fomration and center it, before 2) create a button in every 3d scene view bottom left that can 'turn of' the 3d annotations. simple, performant solution
when adding stacks, there should be a way of doing this. how do you add a square stack to an already existing square stack 
grids are not square
some problem where the stakcs are also stacked.............................
multi-grid support-> houdini
make an extensive test dataset for every folder to make sure the logic and distribution of images is exact.
build a simulation in houdini for designing the stacks.
make camer angle buttons for the 3d viewers. 
annotations go over left side of div
when hohvering over a annotation, you cant zoom in or navigate in the 3d scene.
annotations go over div when 3d scene is placed right, with a text div, combied with another div
make sure the html text files are properly formatted such that weeird margins dont occur
zoom does not work properly.  check it 
3d viewer interactivity, clickable etc  🔥 🔥 🔥 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
boerder between 3d and other disc is not white. should be white.
make directories on the 3d viewer, clickable. we need to know at all times where we are at.  🔥 🔥 ⭐⭐⭐ nvisible folders? perhaps not all folders need to be visible.  🔥 🔥 🔥 ⭐⭐⭐⭐
magenta tree view ofr depht. ⭐⭐⭐
make sure that the 3d views are in the center of the stacks. now its the origin. it should be the height/2 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 

div should match tree viewer 

rethink navigation system. perhaps with arrows instead of a lineair directory?


shocase the current level in the treeviewer by a different color.
make a test html with everything included
text annotations support 🔥🔥 🔥⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
loading screen with stacks and images
iframe support. all of these need a lot of styling
tyle text + images. + how can we load in those images. different folder? 🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥⭐⭐⭐
code optimialisation, now 540 lines. way too much 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
houdini-3d slices support  🔥🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
3d multi grid support  🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
many performance tests  🔥 🔥 ⭐
tresstest. 5000 images on low bandwidth  🔥 ⭐⭐⭐
build in anti spam click, as this loads in textiures rapidly and crashed browser
gif support 🔥🔥 ⭐⭐  ---> need to wok on differntial rate, and extracting correct framerate/frames. now its max 20 frames
center objects, rotate not even. get a proper zoom on the camera because everything is rotated on 0,0,0, it should be 0,0,0 but y is the half of the stack. + add a random zoom that is depending on a seed.   🔥⭐

done----------------
now zooming is kinda random but it should depend on stack. zoom in stack first with bbox, thn apply a random zoom. will be way better
annotations dont turn with model rotation !!!!!!!!!!!!
geometry is now in the center
loading with delay test. can we load images sequentially.  🔥 ⭐
images load sequentially 
very performative
threejs helpers, grid and axis for easier tezting 🔥 🔥 🔥🔥 ⭐
fix incorrect images: not really, just delete the bad ones. better for git and consistancy etc.
fix multiple spritesheet overlaps: i guess. dont see any prominent bugs atm
delete spritesheets on re-run
